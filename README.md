# Average-of-N-Inputs

Question Explanation:

The program is designed to compute the average of a specified number of inputs. Given a number N, the program reads N inputs (integers) and calculates their average.

Logical Approach:

Read Number of Inputs (N):
Read the integer N, which represents the number of inputs for which the average needs to be calculated.

Read Inputs and Calculate Sum:
Initialize a variable sum_of_numbers to 0, which will store the sum of the inputs.
Use a loop (while or for loop) to read N inputs.
In each iteration of the loop, read an integer input and add it to sum_of_numbers.

Calculate Average:
Calculate the average by dividing sum_of_numbers by N.

Output:
Print the calculated average, ensuring it is in the format of a float.

Example for Clarity:

If N = 5 and the inputs are 3, 6, 2, 8, and 1:
The sum of these numbers is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 1 = 20.
The average is 20 / 5 = 4.0.
The output should be 4.0.
